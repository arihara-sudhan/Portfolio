					<h3>Celebrating ONE Year! üéâ</h3>
				</div>
				<span>A year has flown by at Zoho, and it feels like I've just started this remarkable journey. Balancing between exploration and exploitation in the realm of computer vision has been both challenging and rewarding. This experience has shaped me into a more research-oriented individual, drawing inspiration from the likes of Mr. SRK and Mr. Fasil.

Throughout this one-year adventure, the guidance and support from both Mr. SRK and Mr. Fasil have been instrumental. Mr. Fasil's knack for navigating through challenging situations, especially those pesky saddle points, has been truly transformative. My heartfelt thanks go to Mr. SRK for his unique approach in respecting and empowering employees, regardless of age differences ‚Äì a quality that has left a lasting impression on me.

Reflecting on this unforgettable year, I am grateful for the learning, growth, and the chance to collaborate with such inspiring individuals.
