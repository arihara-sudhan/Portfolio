					<h3>Designation : Machine Learning Engineer</h3>
				</div>
				<span>On the second day, the revelation dawned upon me regarding the role I was assigned: that of a Machine Learning Engineer. What? üò≥ Yes, indeed! Despite my initial lack of experience in the realm of Machine Learning, a tremendous learning journey awaited. Thanks to the guidance of my team leader, the seasoned SRK, whose mentoring style and extensive expertise in Machine Learning became the catalyst for my growth.

Fast forward to June 7, 2023, the day I officially assumed the role. Within the innovative domain of ZLabs (R&D), I transformed into a fledgling bird finding its place to nestle. Gratitude is owed not only to Mr. SRK, a beacon of experience üò≥‚ù§Ô∏è, but also to my own determination to surpass limitations and venture into uncharted territories.</span>
