					<h3>Designation : Project Trainee</h3>
				</div>
				<span>I have started my career as a Project Trainee in Zoho corporation, Coimbatore.</span>
				<span>It is a wonderful value-adding journey for me. It's my pleasure to disclose that it is only because of my teachers and supporters.</span>
				<span>It's a lovely feeling to be the first software engineer of my village. </span>
				<span>I am still wondering of how it's going to be.</span>
				<span>In this reputed Indian MNC , I want to be a shining star.</span>

					<h3>Designation : Machine Learning Engineer</h3>
				</div>
				<span>I understood for which role I was there only in the second day. It's the role of Machine Learning Engineer. What ? üò≥</span>
				<span>Yes! It was. I had ZERO experience in Machine Learning. But, I could learn a lot of it.</span>
				<span>Because of my team leader, SRK's way of mentoring and immense experience in Machine Learning, I could roar along with him.</span>
				<span>Now, It's June 07,2023, the day I start the position. In the department of ZLabs (R&D), Ari became a new bird to nestle.</span>
				<span>This time, I have to thank Mr.SRK (Man with such an experience üò≥‚ù§Ô∏è) and myself for having such a mindset to go beyond.</span>
