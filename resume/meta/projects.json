    "description": "Developed a few-shot Doc2Vec model, beginning with ResNet-50 and later transitioning to DiT (Vision Transformer pretrained on a document dataset). Implementation: Extracted document embeddings and performed few-shot training using Triplet Loss. Achieved 100% similarity search accuracy with well-labeled data. Key Insights: Found that classification models could sometimes behave like few-shot models and vice versa. Integrated multimodal training, combining visual features from ResNet with textual features from BERT, which led to strong generalization capabilities.",
