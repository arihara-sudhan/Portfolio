    "description": "The goal of this research was to develop a method for few-shot classification of documents with high intra-class variance. Initially, Triplet Loss was used for few-shot training, and experiments began with ResNet-50, whose convolution-based embeddings captured simple patterns, achieving 74% similarity search accuracy using FAISS. To enhance performance, I explored Google ViT's last hidden state for embeddings, but it performed poorly. Transitioning to DiT (Document Image Transformer), pretrained on the RVL-CDIP dataset with masking as the pretext task, yielded 96% accuracy. Interestingly, I observed classification models exhibiting few-shot behavior and vice versa. Hierarchical classification was introduced, where a superclass like 'Advertisement' included subclasses such as 'Toothpaste Advertisement' and 'Mobile Advertisement'. Through careful dataset annotation, we achieved 100% accuracy, though generalization remained limited. To address this, I extracted textual features via OCR using Tesseract and BERT, combined them with visual features from DiT, and performed multimodal training, significantly improving generalization capabilities.",
